Feel free to help contributing to this repo with more stuff, here are some things that I haven't yet took care of:

- Better install ProtonVPN, enable it when the AppVM starts, and enable `Always-on VPN` and `Block connections without VPN`

- Install [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/berkley4/ungoogled-chromium-debian)

- More security tips?
