# GrapheneOS Setup

Setting up GrapheneOS is a simple process. Follow the installation instructions provided at [GrapheneOS Installation Guide](https://grapheneos.org/install/). Before proceeding, ensure your device is compatible with the OS by checking the [Supported Devices List](https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices).

## Before We Start

Before we start, make sure you go to `Settings -> Display` and set Dark Theme: On

Ok now we're talking. Let's continue.

## User Account Creation

After successful setup, create user accounts based on your requirements. This is a recommended step to maximize privacy, as using separate profiles for different tasks can compartmentalize your data and limit the extent of potential privacy breaches. You can create user accounts by navigating to: `Settings -> System -> Multiple users -> Allow multiple users`. Here are some examples of potential user accounts:

- Primary (Root, default account)
- Personal
- Work
- Kids
- Shopping
- Finance

Each account should be used for its specific purpose to maintain the boundaries between different types of activities.

## Network Settings

Adjust your network settings as follows:

- Turn Off Wi-Fi Automatically: Off
- Notify For Public Networks: Off
- Auto Disable Wi-Fi: Set to 5 minutes

In the Hotspot settings, modify the default name to a more generic one.

## Connected Devices

Under `Connected devices -> Bluetooth`, change the device name to a generic one for privacy.

## Notifications and Battery

Turn off sensitive notifications for privacy. In the Battery settings, enable the option to display the battery percentage.

## Privacy Settings

In the Privacy settings, disable access for both the camera and microphone. Also, make sure the 'Show passwords' setting is turned off.

## Quick Settings

Pin 'Camera access' and 'Microphone access' to the top of your Quick Settings. This will let you quickly enable or disable them as needed.

## App Stores

For app installations, visit the [Neo Store GitHub page](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store), find the latest release, and download the .apk file. Allow the default browser of GrapheneOS, Vanadium, to install unknown apps and proceed to install NeoStore.

In NeoStore, search for and install the Aurora Store. Following this, navigate back to `Apps -> Vanadium -> Install unknown apps` and turn off 'Allow from this source'.

```
Enjoy your secure, privacy-enhanced experience with GrapheneOS!
